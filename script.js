One person or branch wanting a number of new items and interactions in VBS is unlikely to happen unless the demand is high. Even if it was to happen it wouldn't be for some years. That was my first instance of understanding that while training is the goal/objective, we are a business and business needs come first. When future updates come out, I will focus on applying the latest learning practice and how we can use the update as is, keeping within the current capabilities to enhance training."

I ended up doing it and was glad I did it. There were a couple of hiccups but luckily Steve was online from home to help with any computer issues. nowadays people love videos for learning and info. So I put up videos on VBS and the new updates for while we were waiting for everyone to settle, and I think that got them interested in what we were going to do. I think doing this for all levels of training could help gain interest in VBS itself. I also created a short presentation so there were visuals for what i was talking about. I could then leave this up at the end so the basic questions of “where can i find this” can be answered by looking at the screen. One issue I came across was a pair of girls had had a bad day and so wasn’t really interested in the main task/game, she had asked about tanks and so I moved her to a corner of the map and spawned some tanks and air vehicles in for her to look at and play around with. Realistically they are here to learn about the latest learning practices which is VBS, the method in which they learn about it isn’t as important.

I was more nervous about this because it is an entirely different group of people. Cadets are there to have fun and learn about the latest learning practices in the army whereas the troops are on an actual course. I therefore was not confident enough to do it completely on my own. my mentor, the group leader and I spoke and came to a compromise where we work together, I run VBS and the leader of the group speaks on my behalf. I was told there would be a much larger group than there was. In hindsight I think I could have led the small group myself. However, I’m still shocked Id even agree to assist on my own, Steve was not available for the entire training period."

If gathering feedback from co-workers, gather feedback from people who feel neutral or positive about you as those who feel negative about you probably are not going to provide constructive criticisms, especially in an anonymous survey.
Providing a set of questions as well as ratings (1 to 5) can help with getting relevant feedback. You can focus the questions on areas you want to assess where you are at or specific things you want to work on. Doing a self assessment can help with this process.
Open ended questions can allow for anything you may have not thought of, whether that be strengths and areas of development or ideas for goals / ways of getting better. All of which can help you identify areas of developments as well as strengths you may not have known you had in a constructive way.`

If the response to one rating was low for every person, that is a noticeable area of development, where as on where the ratings are very varied may not be as helpful in identifying an area.
Think about whether this is something you can change and how long it would take to change (if you are anxious or quiet that is not something that changes overnight as opposed to file or desk organisation).
Once identified, use this feedback and self assessment, to pick a few areas (based on importance), create a plan or smart goals both short and long term. Or if you already have a Personal Development Plan, update it with these.`

It can allow the user to learn from anywhere at any time. This makes learning more inclusive, for example, to those with other commitments or who need more time or maybe have trouble accessing a physical location.
Some if not most online videos or classrooms have auto generated subtitles, which while not always 100% accurate can aid those with visual impairments or even those who speak other languages (as even if auto generated captions for other languages aren't available the english captions can help aid translation). The hearing impaired can also control the volume, if they need it louder. It also allows you to go back or pause if you miss anything or need time to write things down.
Moodle is an LMS or Learning Management System that makes use of these features. At Babcock's Minley site, Moodle is the main learning platform used. It contains the pre learning, for when the trainees do flipped classroom learning. It also contains all of the resources for revision and some of the classes provided are on there.`

          content: `LXP or Learning Experience Platforms, are like LMS’ but better. It's more learner centred, using AI and analytics so learning can be personalised to the user. It can be used to help gauge where a learner is at, providing more help on the topics the data shows they find more difficult. While reducing time wasted on topics the learner is confident in. This could also help track interests, skills and areas of development. If they linger on a page or a set of pages on x topic, they can be recommended a course in x.
LPX often uses gamification, this helps keep learners engaged and wanting to use the system more. Often it'll have a points system, with points for streaks or daily check-ins or completion of tasks. This is positive reinforcement, encouraging the learning behaviours. Often the learning on platforms like this contain short videos with questions to reinforce learning and check understanding. This again, can help keep the learners engaged, ensuring they're actually learning and not just trying to get through the tasks.`

However as we work with the royal engineers, understanding the ins and outs of things can be advantageous. At our Lyneham branch, they use 3d models of interactive objects, e.g. pipes and valves. You can see things flowing through and what happens to those things when you turn a valve. This can be extremely useful as ordinarily this would be taught with a 2d diagram which can be hard to visualise or a real pipe which you cant see the insides of, making it harder to make the connection. This is an example of where something interactive is better than a powerpoint or real life demonstration.`

They could have one on the contact us page where potential customers or suppliers put in queries or propositions. This can be stored and analysed later, are we getting a lot of the same training requests? Is this a gap in the market? Do we have the capabilities? Etc.
Tie this into the IIS on all courses and departments and abilities we have. Take learning about pipes for example, if they wanted models what can we offer them? We have a 3D modeller with a 3D printer and a multimedia team with online 3D model capabilities. What are the cost differences and turn around times? - we could look at previous models made, how long they took, and price estimates. For the online one we would also have data on how often the models are used, engagement rates as well as other stats on learning.
There will also be one containing all of the current employees' information. At my workplace we need someone to redo the Moodle packages. The Internal info system could be used to find the best fit for the task - whose current skill sets are the most similar, what kind of training could we provide them so they could fill this need, would they even be interested in a course, do they regularly pick up courses offered? Etc.
On our internal system we upload our PDRs or Performance and development reviews, this is where the employee writes down goals for the year. This is reviewed later, where managers assess strengths and areas for developments and how the goal progress is going. This helps the employee feel more a part of the team and helps them work to become a better employee, also if they have anything they are interested in learning or training this is a way of letting it be known and the manager can help facilitate this goal.`

Media team: they deal with headshots, websites, QR codes, banners, anything media related but specifically for the L&D team.
Schedulers/admin: They enter the information on all of the applicants or trainees. As well as scheduling courses throughout the year. We often run multiple of the same course, so spreading those out over the year as to ensure every course is booked in on the (limited) facilities eg the fields or training grounds or lake. They also take into account usual off periods for soldiers, as well as bank holidays making sure to schedule around those. They book facilities and equipment for each course with internal and external places. They are also the ones that deal with any changes or cancellations. If a group can’t use the field because of adverse weather conditions they rearrange schedules based on level of importance and availability. As everything in the course is usually in place for a reason, eg a competency that has to be marked off and therefore the trainees can’t miss it and have to do it another time.
Training developer: They receive the requirements laid out by the TNA or training analysts. Based on that they develop the course specification and potential delivery points for the trainer.
Training facilitator: The person that delivers the training to the trainees. They receive the specs as well as potential delivery points and create their learning resources based on this. They are the ones that interact with the learners.
Director of L&D: They keep everything under control, making sure everyone is going at a good pace. They deal with issues if they arise and are the point of contact for the higher ups as well as the customer e.g. the army. Between them they make decisions which are distributed throughout the L&D team.
Training designer: When elearning modules are involved or anything that needs to be designed (other than facilitators PowerPoints) the designer deals with this. Creating what is needed based on the specs.
Training quality assessor: They go round and randomly check on courses, gathering feedback on everything from did the course deliver what you wanted, do you feel it helped to how was the food and accommodation. He ensures everything is up to spec, and any issues are sent to the right people.
Training analysts: They review courses every 5 years. They ask the wider regimen how the soldiers are and if there’s anything they think should be done differently. With this and research, they create a document outlining what changes need to be made and why. This is what is passed on to the training developers.
Training assistant: They assist with training, the parts that the trainer may not have control of. Eg the simulation suite. Setting everything up before and closing everything down after. Providing guidance with the simulation software and then assisting with any queries or problems with the computers or users.`

I also create missions as and when requested by putting items and objects in the simulation software. We offer multiple courses here, within the courses such as the commander course, there are specific training parts. Physical field training, knowledge based, they may be asked questions and skill based, where they are expected to demonstrate the thing. In the commander course there is a need for communication, leadership and organisational skills. This can be practised in the simulation suite.
